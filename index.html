		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>Our idea is that of an online flea market specializing in video games. On the one hand, you might own some games that are no longer sold on traditional platforms. It will be easy for you to list them for sale at a fixed price on our site. On the other hand, you have been looking for the game that rocked your childhood for years, you will certainly be able to find it from another enthusiast on this interactive shopping platform.




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>A golden opportunity to find a wide choice of games still used by many gamers.
			This idea responds to a strong demand from gamers who can no longer obtain certain parts on obsolete consoles for the current market but still very active in many homes. The seller puts his game on sale at a fixed price, accessible to everyone with the technical details of the game and the console used. The state of wear and the number of hours of play are two mandatory criteria specified. It will only take a short time to find a gamer who wants to own this game. The purchase is made via a secure platform. Shipping costs are the responsibility of the recipient. It will only take a few days to be able to (re)taste the pleasures of a game forgotten by the industry but not by the players.

		   	<h3>Why call on us?</h3>
		   	<p>Calling on us is the assurance of rediscovering a past pleasure, for a reasonable cost. This interactive platform does not meet the current codes of the video game industry and will delight old consoles as well as the gamers who own them. It's like hunting for old games in flea markets but from your home.
